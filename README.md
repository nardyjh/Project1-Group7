# Project1-Group7

Project Summary:

The gaming industry has been rapidly growing in size in the past decade, as technology advances exponentialy, and boosted by the pandemic lockdowns. According to a report by the World Economic Forum [1], the global gaming industry revenues are expected to exceed $320 billion by 2026. With the high number of competitors and increasing number of ways to game (offline/online, different platforms), studios need reliable information and data on which they can base their future plans and strategic decisions. 

The goal of this project is to provide concrete data and analysis that help game studios make informed decisions and navigate the dynamic gaming landscape effectively. The project involves analyzing video game datasets from Steam and IMDB and visualizing different aspects.

Some datapoints to analyze include marketing factors (the effectiveness of game demos and how prices vary from initial release price to final price), hardware decisions (platform availability), top performing games by recommendation and Metacritic ratings (overall and by top genre), game popularity/success per different categories (single-player/multiplayer). We are also analyzing genres, including genre trends in the past 3 decades and upcoming genre trends (thorugh linear regression), and popularity/ratings by genre.
